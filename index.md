<h1> WOSP-C 2020 is Moving On-Line! </h1>
<p>
WOSP-C 2020 is moving on-line together with ICPE 2020 and its associated workshops because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The technical program has been modified accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Registration is FREE! Send an email to icpe2020-virtual[at]easychair.org with your name and email to register. Registration allows on-line attendance at ICPE 2020 and all the associated workshops. Instructions for access will be supplied once you have registered.
</p>
<p>
Our workshop will be streamed live from 09:00 to 11:00 Edmonton MDT (New York-2, Berlin-8). It will be followed immediately by HotCloudPerf <a href="https://hotcloudperf.spec.org/participate">https://hotcloudperf.spec.org/participate</a>. The originally scheduled authors have been invited to give abbreviated presentations of their work followed by a discussion. Participants are encouraged to download the slides and papers via the links indicated in the SLACK channel. Each group of three presentations will be followed by a short panel discussion at the time indicated.</p>
<p>
Schedule: (all times are in Edmonton MDT, New York-2, Berlin-8).

<h3>WOSP-C 2020: Workshop on Challenges and Opportunities in Large Scale Performance</h3>
<p>Topic: Performance and System Measurement and Analytics</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The WOSP-C series of workshops on challenges in software performance has taken place at every ICPE except ICPE 2019 since ICPE 2015. It provides a forum for the discussion of emerging or unaddressed challenges in software and performance, including challenges in developing software to be performant, concurrent programming issues, performance and architecture, performance measurement, cloud performance, and testing. Some of the topics have later become the subject of workshops and conference papers in their own right.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In recent years, tools have proliferated to measure and analyze the resource usage and application activity of large-scale systems hosted on vast numbers of physical or virtual machines. Drawing inferences about performance, identifying performance bottlenecks, reducing performance test data, generating performance requirements, and computing the parameters of performance models all require the assistance of analytics tools to make dealing with large numbers of data sources tractable. The goal of this workshop is to explore performance challenges and their relationship to software engineering in these emerging areas.</p>



<h3>Objective and Proposed Topics</h3>
<p>The objective of this workshop is to bring together tool builders, practitioners and researchers who address the problems described above. Among the questions we hope to address in the workshop are:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
What are the principles underlying the analysis of large numbers of performance measures collected from disparate parts of the system?</li>
<li>
How does one link these performance measures to the architectures of large-scale systems?
</li>
<li>
How does one reconcile performance measures obtained from a system in one virtual environment with competition from another environment in the cloud?
</li>
<li>
Can the baselining of measurements provide a foundation for intrusion detection?
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Contributions are welcomed in any of the following areas, as well as on related topics:</h3>
<p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Non-intrusive measurement of resource usage and performance on a large scale</li>
<li>Building workload models from analytics</li>
<li>Workload measurement for load generation</li>
<li>Performance-oriented diagnosis of concurrent programming, scheduling, and functional problems</li>
<li>Modeling the performance of systems and components under development</li>
<li>Automated generation of performance requirements and modeling parameters</li>
<li>Inference about performance and concurrency in cloud-based, physically based, and distributed systems</li>
<li>Performance analytics and intrusion detection</li>
</ul>
</p>
